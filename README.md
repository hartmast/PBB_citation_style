# PBB Citation Style

CSL citation style based on the stylesheet of the journal "Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur" (PBB). It heavily draws on the CSL implementation of the Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics (https://editor.citationstyles.org/styleInfo/?styleId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zotero.org%2Fstyles%2Funified-style-sheet-for-linguistics) by Mark Dingemanse et al. This is a beta version that should work well for the most common citation types but not necessarily for non-prototypical ones.

(PBB actually has two different citation styles, one for literary studies and one for linguistics. This style sheet is only for linguistics papers.)
